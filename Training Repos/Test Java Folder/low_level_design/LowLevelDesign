Here, you are given a real world design problem where you have provide solution
using Object Oriented Programming.

To answer low level design, we need to first clarify few question:
- Clarify Requirements and core use-cases
- Identify Entities
- Based on the core usecases of the business, you should identity core methods
- Translate entities into classes
- Define relationship between classes, sometimes you need to draw UML diagrams in interviews
- Implement important methods
- Exception handling - Handling errors, exceptions, edge cases and unexpected input

Best practices for solving low level design:
- Use meaningful names
- Focus on simplicity and readability
- favour composition over inheritance (to provide flexibility over tight coupling)
- user interfaces
- strive for modularity
- apply design patterns and principles
- make your code scalable
